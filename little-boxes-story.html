	    		<h1>The Pink One</h1>
	    		<p>The Pink One is the first track I made for the EP. It dates back to 2016. I had the concept of the EP in mind, and ideas for all three colours but the Pink One. I started to mess around with a seventh chord arpeggio on the piano and made a Hammond sound. These two together create the basis of the track. The mood of the main chord progression was happy enough, so I decided to use this track as The Pink One.</p>
				<p>The tonality was inspired by Hans Zimmer’s Masterclass, in which he said ‘I like writing in D’. I thought, I give it a shot and wrote a few chords with D. They move around this note, so the bass doesn’t change for a very long time. The midsection has a new tonality but is also related to the key. The return of the main motif is a tricky chord change I’m very proud of. I also applied a production trick of Hannah V, and had the luck to meet her in London. She was kind enough to listen to the track and gave very nice feedback, which means a lot to me.</p>
